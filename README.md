👋 I'm Brenton and I'm a web developer living and working on Wiradjuri land in regional Australia.

Some of my projects that I'm focussing on recently:

- [thttp](https://github.com/sesh/thttp) is a tiny HTTP library that you can copy into your project
- [ready](https://github.com/sesh/ready) includes a bunch of go-live / production readiness checks for your website
- [bm2](https://github.com/sesh/bm2) is my personal bookmarks sites and attempts to be an example Django project
